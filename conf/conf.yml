# Frozra configuration file example.
#
# Note that in order to read the configuration file, you must put it
# file in ./conf directory.

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in some specific form. Every specific form will be explained in
# the corresponding comment.

# inmemory used to config memory size that can be used by memory component
# memoryThreshold set the maximum memory size that can be used. unit: GB
# interval sets the frequency of check memory component used memory exceed threshold
# or not. If exceeded threshold frozra will start to use range LSM engine to store
# new key value pairs until memory occupied memory usage drops below the threshold.
# unit: second
inmemory:
  memoryThreshold: 1
  interval: 1

# persistence used to config LSM engine's parameters.
# l0Capacity sets how many tables can be stored in the l0 layer.
# memoryTableSize sets the memory component size of LSM engine. unit: MB
# l1TableSize sets the maximum table size of leve1 layer. unit: MB
# path is table's storage location.
