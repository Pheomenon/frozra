:star: Introduction

frozra is a distributed cache system. The data model is key-value. frozra was inspired by LevelDB, and also use LSM trees as the storage engine. To be precise, frozra use range LSM-tree that use hash string to store every key's position in disk.  Compared with the original LSM-tree, range LSM-tree's advantage is that it basically does not require any sorting for its elements when merge two different layer's table.

ðŸš€ Features

- Self-built cluster, no complicated configuration
- Concise and easy-to-use APIs
- Supporting asynchronous write operation
- Use consistent hashing to achieve load balancing
- Automatic node rebalancing, whether cluster stable or not, the number of elements stored in each node is approximately the same
- use built-in event-driven mechanisms: epoll
